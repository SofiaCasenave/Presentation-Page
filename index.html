          <p>
            Alongside with my academic background which was centered in
            architecture, I am an individual that always had interest in
            computers and learning new software.
          </p>
          <p>
            Very recently I got a real interest in the tech area and coding and
            I started to look for workshops to get acquainted with it. I
            enrolled in
            <span class="highlight">SheCodes Coding Workshop - Lisbon</span> in
            July where I got introduced to the basics of
            <span class="highlight">HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript ES6.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            My final project was to produce a webpage using VS Code and this was
            extremely rewarding. After this I started
            <span class="highlight"
              >SheCodes + Coding Workshop | Front-End Development</span
            >
            workshop in September to develop my coding skills. Only two months
            later, I ended up building two functional Weather Apps, one using
            <span class="highlight"></span>Vanilla Javascript and recreating the
            former in <span class="highlight">React.js.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            To the past skills I added
            <span class="highlight"
              >Bootstrap, Git, GitHub, Hosting, advanced JavaScript, React.js
              and JSX.</span
            >
            I used a real API to retrieve real weather information to my app! My
            curiousness is growing everyday and my absolute goal is to be
            proficient in <span class="highlight">Front-End Development.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a very interesting and powerful area of knowledge and
            besides being in an initial stage I’m very motivated and I believe
            that it’s never too late for me to learn new things and shift 180º
            my course of life and pursue this passion in programming. I'm a
            person with a unique approach which I believe it can enrich the
            projects you may have and bring to the table different points of
            view and diversified ideas.
