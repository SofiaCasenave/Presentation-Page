        Alongside with my academic background which was centered in
        architecture, I am an individual that always had interest in computers
        and learning new software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Very recently I got a real interest in the tech area and coding and I
        started to look for workshops to get acquainted with it. I enrolled in
        SheCodes – Lisbon workshop in July where I got introduced to the basics
        of HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript ES6.
      </p>
      <p>
        My final project was to produce a webpage using VS Code and this was
        extremely rewarding. After this I started SheCodes Plus workshop in
        September to develop my coding skills. Only two months later, I ended up
        building two functional Weather Apps, one using Vanilla Javascript and
        recreating the former in React.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the past skills I added Bootstrap, Git, GitHub, Hosting, advanced
        JavaScript, React.js and JSX. I used a real API to retrieve real weather
        information to my app! My curiousness is growing everyday and my
        absolute goal is to be proficient in Front-End Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a very interesting and powerful area of knowledge and besides
        being in an initial stage I’m very motivated and I believe that it’s
        never too late for me to learn new things and shift 180º my course of
        life and pursue this passion in programming. I'm a person with a unique
        approach which I believe it can enrich the projects you may have and
        bring to the table different points of view and diversified ideas.
